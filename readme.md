## Task
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a Weather APi that gets data from the open weather API. 
We sorted through the data to pull out specific things that we wanted to append to our website such as
the date, humidity, wind, and temperature.
To create this I used html, css, and JavaScript.
I also used the local storage to save past cities to the page after you searched for them.

## Acceptance Criteria

Using a fetch request and .then to get data from the API and then apply it to my code.

## Mock Up
When the user opens the page in the browser they are presented with a text input box to search for a city.
After putting in a city and clicking search the user is presented with 5 day weather forecast data from the open weather API
And displayed in select boxes on the screen.
